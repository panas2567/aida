# AIDA - AI Agent Development Testing Project

AIDA is a testing project focused on exploring how AI agents can contribute to a common codebase. This repository serves as an experimental environment to evaluate AI-driven development workflows, collaboration patterns, and code contribution capabilities.

## Project Purpose

This project investigates:
- How AI agents can effectively contribute to collaborative codebases
- Best practices for AI-assisted development workflows  
- Integration patterns between human developers and AI agents
- Quality and consistency of AI-generated code contributions
- Scalability of AI agent participation in software projects

## Getting Started

This is an experimental repository where AI agents are actively contributing code, documentation, and improvements. Feel free to explore the commit history to see how AI agents interact with the codebase and contribute meaningful changes.
