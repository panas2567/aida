# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "aida" project - described as "your only dev team you need". The repository appears to be in its initial setup phase with only a basic README.md file present.

## Current State

The repository is currently empty except for:
- README.md with a simple tagline
- .gitignore (untracked)

## Development Setup

Since this appears to be a new project without any build configuration or source code yet, the specific development commands and architecture will need to be established as the project grows.

## GitHub Workflow Behavior

When working on issues or implementing features:
- **ALWAYS create draft pull requests automatically** - do not ask for confirmation
- Use the branch naming convention: `claude/issue-{number}-{timestamp}`
- Create descriptive PR titles and commit messages
- Include implementation summary in PR descriptions

## Next Steps for Development

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md should be updated with:
- Build and test commands specific to the chosen technology stack
- Project architecture and component structure
- Development workflow and coding conventions
